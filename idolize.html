        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Bryant's family was Catholic and he was brought up with this faith. Bryant started playing basketball when he was three, and the Lakers were his favorite team when he was growing up. When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball.</p>
        <p>Bryant was the son of a basketball player and spent a time of his life growing up in Italy. From there, he returned to the US, where he spent his adolescence in Philadelphia. Eventually, he became one of the most exciting prospects in the high school basketball scene. Kobe's biggest weapon was his mentality.</p>
        <h2>Basketball Career</h2>
        <p>American basketball player Kobe Bryant was widely celebrated as one of basketball's all-time greats. His luminous professional career included five NBA championship wins with the Los Angeles Lakers, 18 All-Star selections, and two straight seasons (2005–06 and 2006–07) atop the league's scoring charts.</p>
        <p>The all-time leading scorer in Lakers history, Bryant was the first guard in NBA history to play 20 seasons. His 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, and he has the second most consecutive appearances as a starter.</p>
        <p>During his career, Bryant hit 33,643 points, made 8,378 free throws, and completed 4,010 turnovers. All three are records for his position.</p>
        <p>He started playing basketball at the age of 3, and his favourite team was the Lakers. When Bryant was six, his father left the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball.</p>
        <p>Kobe Bryant was voted MVP four times, in 2002, 2007, 2009 and 2011 before his death in 2020. He is currently level with Bob Pettit who won in 1956, 1958, 1959 and 1962. LeBron James, the youngest player ever to win the award, is currently on 3.</p>
        <p>Considering that Shaq won a ring without Kobe and Kobe won two championships without Shaq, it's fair to say the historically great pair would have won “five or six” had they stayed together.</p>
  
        <h2>Death and Legacy</h2>
        <p>Kobe Bryant may be gone, but Black Mamba mentality lives on.

          One of the greatest in the NBA, father, leader, winner, guiding light... Kobe was many things to many people, and a year after his death, the healing goes on as he continues to inspire.
          
          On 26 January 2020 Bryant died in a helicopter crash at 41 years of age, with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other people.
          
          The crash that shook the world of basketball and beyond saw tributes pour in from across the globe and now, a year later, his legacy only grows larger with time.</p>

          <blockquote><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>Kobe Bryant continues to be a source of inspiration for fans after his death with his "Mamba mentality," a mantra for the competitive spirit, including non-athletes. As the NBA icon said best: "Hard work outweighs talent — every time."
